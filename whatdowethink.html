                        <p>After three weeks of gloating about Tottenham's performance, reality hit us like a slap in the face. I watched in dismay as we lost 4-1 to Chelsea, in a poorly officiated match that would burden us with injuries of cricual players Maddison and Van de Ven and red cards for Romero and Destiny Udogie. The following week, despite my naive sense of hope, we lost 2-1 to the Wolves. It only got worse as we lost to Villa the following week. We did manage to scrape a tie in a thrilling match against City (I thought we were back and made the mistake once again of getting my hopes up) before taking yet another loss against West Ham. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Spurs are in the Mud</h2>
                        <p>Every time Tottenham loses, I have to endure a barrage of texts from all of my so-called friends about my club. The most frequent chants that they send me are: "What do we think of Tottenham?" (the rest of the chant has an expletive that I will not include here), and "The Spurs are in the mud...". These chants haunt my nightmares.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">It's the History of Tottenham</h2>
                        <p>Tottenham Hotspur, a club with a rich history and a passionate fan base, has experienced its fair share of highs and lows. While recent years have seen the team rise to prominence under the management of Mauricio Pochettino and now Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo, it's essential to acknowledge the historical struggles that have plagued the North London club. From inconsistent performances to near misses, Tottenham's history is riddled with challenges that have often left fans frustrated and longing for sustained success.</p>
                        <p> One of the most glaring aspects of Tottenham's historical struggles is their trophy drought. Despite being a club with a storied past, the Lilywhites have found it challenging to secure silverware consistently. The last time Tottenham won a major trophy was in 2008 when they lifted the League Cup. Since then, they have endured a barren spell, falling short in crucial moments and failing to capitalize on their potential.
                        <p>Tottenham's history is marked by several near misses, where the club came tantalizingly close to glory only to falter at the final hurdle. The 2016-2017 season is a prime example when Tottenham finished as runners-up in the Premier League, trailing behind Chelsea. The inability to seize such opportunities has been a recurring theme, leaving fans wondering what might have been.</p>
                        <p>Another factor contributing to Tottenham's historical struggles is the inconsistency in managerial appointments. Frequent changes in leadership have disrupted the team's cohesion and hindered the development of a long-term vision. This lack of stability has, at times, resulted in a revolving door of managers and a struggle to establish a distinct footballing identity.</p>                        
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Harry-Kane.avif" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">A disappointed Kane after we lost the Champions League Final to Liverpool in 2019.</span>
                        <p>By now, we're all used to the pain that accompanies a big loss. It doesn't stop it from being so painful when we fail to win crucial matches year after year. The worst part is that every year we get our hopes up when we have a fantastic start to the season or make it to a cup final in good form. But honestly, it's my own fault for getting my hopes up year after year. After all, they say it's the hope that kills you, and they aren't wrong about that.</p>
                        <p>So I guess I'll have to deal with listening to my friends sing "the Spurs are in the mud" for the forseeable future. BUt maybe that'll change with Big Ange... or maybe I should learn my lesson and not get my hopes up again.</p>
