                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>After signing Richarlison de Andrade, known mononymously as Richarlison, for Â£60 million, we all had high hopes for his performance. He had performed well for Everton, with 53 goals and 13 assists in 152 appearances. Even though he had been known to have some attitude issues, we had already dealt with the Dele Alli arc and figured it wouldn't be too much of an issue.</p>   
                        <p>Although he got ample playing time last season, Richarlison only scored one Premier League goal for us. That's a $75,000,000 goal. Was it really worth it?</p>                     
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Need for Efficiency</h2>
                        <p>In the 2022/2023 season, Richarlison scored one goal, a header that completed a late Spurs comeback against Liverpool. Although it was a key goal for Richarlison and Tottenham, it still doesn't change the fact that Richarlison scored one goal in 27 Premier League appearances. Of his 27 shots during those 27 appearances, only 14 of them were on target. A 52% shooting accuracy isn't horrible considering lots of his shots were taken from distance, but it doesn't excuse the fact that he missed 4 big chances during the season.</p>   
                        <img src="https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/05/richarlison-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-817246782.jpg" alt="" width="575px">
                        <span class="caption text-muted">It's rough out there for the Brazilian</span>
                        <p>At the end of the day, we can't keep giving Richi credit when he accumulates more yellow cards than goals in a season as a striker. The real question is, why is the Brazilian performing so poorly for Tottenham? He's proven time and time again that he's a skilled striker, especially in his performances for Everton and more recently for Brazil in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he scored an incredible bike that won goal of the tournament and was a Puskas finalist? If we take a deeper dive into the numbers, there is one statistic that stands out: His touch map. During Tottenham's win vs. Manchester United in August 2023, Richarlison only had 25 touches, the least of all the Spurs players. The same happened versus Brentford, when Richi only had 30 touches during the game. Clearly, he's not getting to the ball often and that could be a large part of the problem.</p>                    
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-brazils-richarlison-celebrates-scoring-778030709.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Bonus points for the pigeon dance though...</span>
                        <p>But is this such an issue? Might Richarlison still be able to have a big contribution to the team under Tottenham's new manager Ange Postecoglou?</p>                       
                        <p>If we look at Ange's playing style with his last team, Celtics, we see a similar pattern with strikers taking few touches but capitilizing on those opportunities. Celtic's star striker, Japanese international Kyogo Furuhashi, scored 27 goals in the 2022 season with only 87 shot attempts. Similar to Richarlison, Furuhashi averaged around 20 touches per game but was still the league's top scorer. How was this possible? It all boils down to efficiency.</p>
                        <p>Efficiency means making the most out of the opportunities that Richarlison has. He has to capitilize on the limited touches that he has during games and convert as many of them as possible into goals. Of course, this is easier said than done, but the bottom line is that Richi can still fit into Ange's style of play and, if he can play efficiently, he can truly make a difference in this Tottenham squad.</p>
